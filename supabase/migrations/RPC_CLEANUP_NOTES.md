# RPC Functions Cleanup Notes

## Date: January 6, 2025

### Current Status

We have successfully implemented and are using the following RPC function:

#### âœ… Active RPC Functions

1. **`get_complete_itinerary_details`**
   - Location: `/supabase/migrations/01_get_complete_itinerary_details.sql` (initial version)
   - Updated: `/supabase/migrations/02_fix_rpc_function.sql` (fixed column names)
   - Final fix: `/supabase/migrations/03_fix_rpc_transactions.sql` (removed non-existent columns)
   - Purpose: Fetches all itinerary data in a single optimized query
   - Status: **ACTIVE - DO NOT DELETE**
   - Used in: `lib/services/itinerary_service.dart` - `loadItineraryDetailsOptimized()` method

### API Calls That Can Be Deprecated

The following API calls are no longer needed as they've been replaced by the RPC function:

1. **Individual Itinerary Items Calls**
   - Previously used multiple calls to fetch items by type
   - Now handled by RPC function returning `items_grouped` with all types

2. **Separate Passenger Queries**
   - Previously: Direct queries to `passenger` table
   - Now: Included in RPC response

3. **Separate Transaction Queries**
   - Previously: Direct queries to `transactions` table
   - Now: Included in RPC response with payment summary

4. **Multiple Contact Lookups**
   - Previously: Separate query to get contact info
   - Now: Contact data included in main RPC response

### Benefits of the RPC Function

1. **Performance**: Reduced from ~5-6 API calls to 1 single call
2. **Data Consistency**: All data fetched in single transaction
3. **Network Efficiency**: Less bandwidth usage
4. **Simplified Code**: Single point of data fetching

### Fallback Mechanism

The code maintains a fallback mechanism in case the RPC function fails:
- `_loadItineraryDetailsFallback()` in `itinerary_service.dart`
- This ensures the app continues working even if RPC has issues

### Next Steps for Cleanup

1. Monitor RPC function performance in production for 1-2 weeks
2. Once stable, consider removing fallback code
3. Update any remaining direct table queries that duplicate RPC functionality
4. Document any edge cases where direct queries are still needed

### Notes

- The RPC function includes calculated totals by product type
- Handles all product types: Vuelos, Hoteles, Servicios, Transporte
- Includes summary flags (has_flights, has_hotels, etc.) for UI logic
- Returns payment summary with balance calculations
